=========================
So far we have tested for
=========================

lexing each individual keyword

setting default values to classes, primitives, arrays

correct/incorrect use of 'this' keyword

correct/incorrect use of break/continue keywords

accessing class attributes from within that class's file only

using parent class's method


=======
TODOS:
=======

testing global variables

ensure global variables can't be defined in interface files

ensure multiple interface files can't define the same class

check subtyping rules for local variables and function arguments

others?
